      What is this graph?

<br><br>

This chart is my own attempt to present a sort of histogram displaying responses to the "how many is a couple/few/several" questions - but instead of just a basic bar chart, this also illustrates the popularity of specific ranges of values or specific exact values.

<br><br>
      
      How do I read it?
      <br><br>

If, say, the height of the bars at number 2 totals to 80%, this would mean that the number 2 was present in 80% of all responses to the question, whether that be as an exact value answer OR within a range answer. But the breakdown of stacked blocks under that column will give a more in-depth view of whether most of that 80% of respondents made their answer the exact value of '2', or a range at '2-X'. The range responses get grouped into unique blocks and may lie on top of each other to overlap across different heights at other integer values, making it look a bit like a stack of pancakes flopped on top of each other.

<br><br>

To my (limited) knowledge, I'm not aware of such a type of graph already exists.

<br><br>
      
I'd love to christen it "the Pancake Graph" but unfortunately that's already the name of a different kind of plot.
      
      <br><br>
      Where did this data come from?
      <br><br>
      I made a survey form available HERE and posted it to the reddit forum r/SampleSize which is great for this sort of stuff.
